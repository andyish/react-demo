# React Demo

A slightly over engineered react app to demonstrate a react/redux/thunk configuration.

It consumes an endpoint that returns a list of data and allows the user to click on an image to view more information.

## Future Work

Future work that could easily be added but omitted from the scope of this project.

* Extract statically typed urls
* Push ducks into relevant modules
* Jest unit tests
* e2e tests (Cypress)
* Storybook
